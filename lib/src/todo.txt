=======================================

Add transitions support to ordered choices.

=======================================

Add instruction optimizations:

Remove "rule" instructions.
Remove "sequence element" instructions w/o actions.
Remove "production rule" instructions w/o memoizations.
Resolve "trusted" "character/character class" instructions and optimize them.

=======================================

remove duplicate instruction data

=======================================

Interpreter: places of expectation error reporting:

choice: report all if no transitions

sequence: not report

unary: not report

terminal: report

TERMINAL <- "abc" / [0..9] # TERMINAL

TERMINAL <- "abc" # abc

Add property: Expression.hasCharacterClass
---
production rule: depends on memoization
  report all if no cached
